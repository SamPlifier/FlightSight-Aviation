                <p>Mauricio Castro is originally from El Salvador and arrived in Boston in 1980. After studying electronics science and technology, he worked in the industry for more than 14 years, mainly in research and development. In 1995, he moved to
                Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where he directed a statewide non-profit that worked to build bridges between immigrant communities and the larger community. Mauricio led many initiatives which, focused on connecting people of multi-faith
                and multi-racial backgrounds with local and state agencies, and resources to improve relations and&nbsp;conditions.
                </p>
                <p>He started in the aviation industry in 2009 when he enrolled for training of manned aircraft. Today, he is a certified pilot, a commercial unmanned pilot (UAS), and an avid participant and supporter of aviation education through formal
                trainings with various national and local flight agencies. Flight safety is Mauricio's primary focus, followed by a strong emphasis on understanding federal and state aviation regulations. He believes real pilots are always learning
                and Mauricio runs his company with that in mind, to the benefit of himself and his clients. He also holds an FCC General class amateur radio&nbsp;license.
